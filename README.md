This library is being actively worked on. It only supports floating point vectors at the moment, but the intention is to eventually offer vectors that can be configured to use integers or single/double floating point precision.

## Features
* **Modern Design:** Written in C++17.
* **Header-only:** Easy to drop into any project.

## Installation
Copy the `include/Vec23` folder into your project's include path.
