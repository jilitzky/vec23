## Roadmap
This library is being actively worked on. It currently only supports floating point 2D vectors but the intention is to eventually offer both 2D and 3D templated vectors that can be configured to use integers or single/double floating point precision.

## Features
* **Modern Design:** Written in C++17.
* **Header-only:** Easy to drop into any project.

## Installation
Copy the entire `Vec23` folder into your project's include path.
